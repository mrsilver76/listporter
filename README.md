# Plex Playlist Uploader (PlexPU)
_A cross-platform command-line tool (Windows, Linux, macOS) for uploading standard or extended `.m3u` audio playlists to Plex Media Server. Supports path rewriting, selective updates and optional mirroring of playlists._

> [!NOTE]
> This program is a complete rewrite of [iTunes Playlist exporter](https://github.com/mrsilver76/itunes_playlist_exporter) and does not export playlists from iTunes. If you wish to export playlists from iTunes then please look at [TuneLift](https://github.com/mrsilver76/tunelift).

## Features
* üíª Runs on Windows, Linux (x64 & ARM) and macOS.
* üìÇ Uploads standard or extended M3U audio playlists to Plex.
* üåê Works with any Plex server platform (Windows, Linux, NAS, macOS) via the Plex API.
* ‚úÖ Skips uploading playlists that haven‚Äôt changed.
* ü™û Mirrors Plex playlists to match uploaded M3U files (optional)
* üîÅ Force playlist paths to use `/` or `\` to match your Plex server‚Äôs file path format (Linux, macOS, NAS, or Windows).
* üõ†Ô∏è Modify playlist file paths using find & replace rules, ensuring they align with how Plex sees your media library.
* üßπ Deletes all Plex playlists before upload (optional)
* üìò Logs activity to timestamped text files

## Quick start guide

Below are a couple of command scenarios for using PlexPU. They will work on all platforms.

```
PlexPU -s 127.0.0.1 -t ABCDEFG -l 8 -i "C:\Playlists\Running.m3u"

PlexPU --server 127.0.0.1 --token ABCDEFG --library 8 --import "C:\Playlists\Running.m3u"
```
* Connect to the Plex server running on the same machine
* Use Plex token `ABDEFGH`
* Use music library ID `8`
* Upload only `C:\Playlists\Running.m3u`

```
PlexPU -s 192.168.1.100 -t ABCDEFG -l 4 -I "/home/mrsilver/playlists/" -m -w

PlexPU --server 192.168.1.100 --token ABCDEFG --library 4 --import "/home/mrsilver/playlists/running.m3u" --mirror --windows
```
* Connect to Plex Server running at `192.168.1.100`
* Use Plex token `ABDEFGH`
* Use music library ID `4`
* Upload all playlists in `/home/mrsilver/playlists`
* Remove any playlists from Plex that aren't uploaded (mirror)
* Replace Linux forward slashes (`/`) in the playlist path to backslashes (`\`)

```
PlexPU -s pimachine -t ABCDEFG -l 10 -i "C:\Playlists" -l -f "C:/Users/MrSilver/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Music" -r "/home/pi/music" -d

PlexPU --server pimachine --token ABCDEFG --library 10 --import "C:\Playlists" --linux --find "C:/Users/MrSilver/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Music" --replace "/home/pi/music" --delete
```
* Connect to Plex Server running at `pimachine`
* Use Plex token `ABCDEFG`
* Use music library `ID` 10
* Upload all playlists found in `C:\Playlists`
* Replace Windows backslashes (`\`) in the playlist path to forward slashes (`/`)
* Replace `C:/Users/MrSilver/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Music` in the playlist paths to `/home/pi/music`
* Delete all playlists on Plex first before importing

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using `-l` will cause the any backslashes (`\`) in the filename and path to be replaced with with forward slashes (`/`) **before any search and replace is performed**. This is why the search string is written as `C:/Users/MrSilver/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Music`.

## Command line options

PlexPU -s <address>[:<port>] -t <token> -l <library> -i <path> [options]
